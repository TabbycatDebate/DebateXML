# A Debating Tournament Archive Spec

Hello MDR readers! Discussion's happening over at the [Issues section](https://github.com/TheAgoraProject/dta-spec/issues), please do join in, especially if you have familiarity with debating styles not already represented in the discussion. Documents in the repository record the current state of the proposal.

If you haven't seen the _Monash Debating Review_ article describing the motivation for this specification, it's here:
